# SENG-265
A collection of assignments from SENG 265 (2025). All programs within this repository are coded using the Python and C programming languages, with most aiming to manipulate YAML and CSV dataset files. A term portfolio (split into two parts) is also provided to showcase my learning journey throughout the semester.
